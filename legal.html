                    <p>WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY, AND TO CONTACT US IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. BY USING OUR SERVICES OR REGISTERING FOR A PROGRAM, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS, OR ARE NOT ABLE TO ENTER INTO A BINDING AGREEMENT, THEN YOU MAY NOT REGISTER FOR A PROGRAM, OR USE OUR SERVICES.<br><br>‍<strong>A. Welcome to Landa!<br><br>‍</strong>This Agreement (&quot;Terms&quot;) sets out the terms and conditions that govern your use of Landa&#x27;s products and services (including website services and program content), as well as your registration for any degree, course or other program (&quot;Program&quot;) offered by Landa (as owned and operated by Landa Technologies).<br><br>Each Program is delivered in collaboration with at least one entity responsible for the educational content of the particular Program (“Education Institution”), and some wording and phrases used in specific Program delivery may differ depending on each Education Institution&#x27;s rules and standards. Accordingly, the following words and phrases may be used interchangeably in these Terms, as well as on our website, and/or in the Virtual Learning Campus/Learning Platforms through which Programs are delivered: “degree” and &quot;program/programme&quot;; &quot;course&quot; and &quot;program/programme&quot;; &quot;learner&quot;, &quot;student&quot; and &quot;participant&quot;; &quot;program/programme material&quot;; &quot;program/programme content&quot;; &quot;course material&quot; and &quot;course content&quot;; &quot;Tutor&quot;, “Lecturer”, “Facilitator”, &quot;Professor&quot; and &quot;Learning Facilitator&quot;; “Head Tutor” and “Head Learning Facilitator”; “Head of Department” and “Head of Program/Programme”, “Markers” and “Assessors”; &quot;Honor Code&quot; and &quot;Code of Conduct&quot;; “Degree”, “Credential”, “Certificate” and/ or “Badge”; “Certificate of Completion”, “Certificate of Attendance”, “Executive Certificate” and/or “Certificate of Participation”; “Virtual Learning Campus (VLC)” and “Learning Platform(s)”; and, “Program/Programme Prospectus”, “Program/Programme Brochure”, “Program/Programme Information Packet”, “Degree Prospectus”, “Degree Brochure”, “Degree Information Packet”, “Course Prospectus”, “Course Brochure” and “Course Information Packet”.<br><br>Although all of the content in these Terms is important, please pay particular attention to terms that are emphasized in “<strong>bold</strong>” text.<br><br>By agreeing to these Terms, you also consent to the following policies applicable to, and accessible on, our websites [including the website at <a href="https://www.landalearn.com" class="text-style-link">www.landalearn.com</a>, or Virtual Learning Campus (VLC), all our Learning Platforms, and such other URLs that we may indicate from time to time (&quot;Website/s&quot;)], which are incorporated by reference into these Terms: our Privacy Policy, Cookie Policy, Website Terms of Use, and any other policy that is made available on our Websites from time to time (&quot;Policies&quot;).<br><br>If your participation in a Program is being paid for by a third party, such as a sponsor or your employer (“sponsor”), then you are still bound by all provisions in these Terms (including payment provisions), however we may enter into a separate agreement with your sponsor to govern payment for the Program on your behalf, as well as to govern the receipt of certain information in relation to your completion of the Program.<br><br><strong>Tax forms, tax rebates, subsidy claim forms and employer compensation: Please note that the Programs offered by Landa in collaboration with Education Institutions are non-credit bearing. Furthermore, the administration of these Programs is handled by Landa on behalf of the Educational Institution, which may not be an “educational institution” for tax purposes in your jurisdiction. If your employer offers remuneration for educational programs, it is your responsibility to check with them if this Program meets their requirements for remuneration. Similarly, it is your responsibility to establish if these Programs will qualify for a tax rebate. Landa will not issue or complete any tax or related forms.</strong><br><br><strong>B. Accessing Landa<br><br>Acceptance: <br><br>By clicking on the &quot;I Accept the Terms and Conditions for learners&quot; button when signing up for a Program, you agree to be bound by these &quot;Terms&quot;, which include, by reference, the Policies.</strong>‍<br><br>‍<strong>Accurate information</strong>: All information (including personal information) provided to us on registration, on creating an account, or while accessing Landa services and Programs, must be true, accurate and complete. You are also responsible for updating us in the event of a change to your information (for example, your name or address). All personal information will be processed in accordance with our Privacy Policy.<br><br><strong>Sanctions:</strong> To enroll in a Program, you must be eligible to enroll in such Program (including clearing any Landa sanctions screening). You (and your sponsor, if applicable) must not be subject to any sanctions, executive orders, regulations, or other such governmental actions prohibiting your enrollment, including paying to enroll in the Program. You warrant that you (and your sponsor, if applicable) a) do not reside or are currently resident in a sanctioned territory, including Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria, or the Crimea, LPR, or DPR regions of Ukraine; and b) you (and your sponsor, if applicable) are not on a government’s sanction list(s) prohibiting your enrollment, including paying for your Program enrollment.<br><br><strong>License</strong>: Subject to these Terms, and to the payment of any applicable fees, we grant you a limited, personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable and revocable license to use our services and products, including all services associated with our Programs, and the Learning Platform through which Program content is accessed.<br><br><strong>Suitability of Program: Before registering for any Program, you are responsible for establishing the relevance and suitability of the Program for your individual requirements, through consideration of the information supplied through our Websites, and asking questions, if necessary.</strong><br><br><strong>Commencement of Program:</strong> You will only receive confirmation of your registration for a Program, and be allowed access to the Learning Platform, once you (or your sponsor) have made the required minimum payment for the Program (unless otherwise specifically stated in the information pack relevant to your Program). There may also be a delay of access to the Learning Platform until you are formally enrolled in our records, or until the Program commences if your selected Program has a commencement date.<br><br>‍<strong>Minors:</strong> You will not be allowed to register for a Program if you are under the age of 16. If you are between the age of 16 and 18, you must obtain the written consent and assistance of your parent or legal guardian to enter into these Terms and register for a Program.<br><br><strong>Accessibility statement:</strong> Landa is committed to providing Learning Platforms that are accessible to the widest possible audience. We are actively working to increase the accessibility and usability of our Website and Learning Platforms for all our learners, including those with disabilities.<br><br>‍<strong>Standards</strong>: We aim to conform to level AA of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0.<br><br>‍<strong>Reviews:</strong> Our Learning Platforms are periodically reviewed by an accessibility expert who uses a range of different assistive technologies and computer settings to test the Learning Platforms for conformance with the above standards of accessibility.<br><br>‍<strong>Exceptions:</strong> While we strive to ensure that our Learning Platforms conform to level AA of the WCAG 2.0, there may be exceptions where a Learning Platform is not fully up to level AA standard. We are continually seeking out solutions that will bring all areas of the Website and our Learning Platforms up to the same level of overall accessibility, while ensuring that the overall learner experience is not unduly compromised.<br><br>‍<strong>Accessibility requests</strong>:<strong> If you experience any difficulty in accessing any aspect of the Website or an Learning Platform and would like to know more about our accessibility accommodations, please don&#x27;t hesitate to contact us or speak to your Enrolment Adviser or Success Adviser. Landa reviews all requests for disability-related accessibility accommodations and resolves to take commercially reasonable steps to extend a Learning Platform functionality to accommodate our learners.</strong><br><br><strong>C. Program requirements</strong>‍<br><br>‍<strong>Basic requirements</strong>:<strong> In order to register in, receive certain support, and complete a Program you must be proficient in English (as well as the language the applicable Program is primarily offered in) and you will need a current valid email account and access to a computer and the internet. You should be familiar with using a computer and accessing the internet</strong>, as you may need to be able to read documents in Adobe PDF Reader, view Microsoft PowerPoint presentations, and read and create documents in Microsoft Word. You can download Adobe Reader here: <a href="https://get.adobe.com/reader/?promoid=BUIGO" class="text-style-link">https://get.adobe.com/reader/?promoid=BUIGO<br><br></a><strong>Browser requirements:</strong> We recommend that you use Google Chrome as your internet browser when accessing the Learning Platform. Although this is not a requirement, we have found that this browser performs best for ease of access to Program material. This browser can be downloaded from the following website: <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/" class="text-style-link">https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/</a>.<br><br><strong>Additional requirements:</strong> Certain Programs may require additional software and resources. These additional software and resource requirements will be communicated to learners upon registration and/or at the beginning of the Program. <strong>Please note that Google, Vimeo, Zoom, AWS, and YouTube may be used in our Program delivery, and if these services are blocked in your jurisdiction, you may have difficulty in accessing Program content – we strongly recommend that you check with us before registering for a Program if you have any concerns about this affecting your experience with the Learning Platform</strong>. If we include third-party applications (“Third Party Apps”) in a Program, you shall accept and agree to be bound by any Third Party Apps terms and conditions attributable to such applications. You are obliged to source and obtain access to the necessary software and resources required for Program completion at your own cost, and we won&#x27;t be held liable for any consequences of the use of such software or resources. We do not sponsor or endorse, nor are we affiliated with, the entities responsible for software and resources unless expressly stated otherwise – these are simply programs chosen for their global use patterns and effectiveness for the Program outcomes. We may change the Program requirements for a particular Program at any time by advising you through the applicable Learning Platform or by email to your chosen email address.<br><br><strong>Identification</strong>: During the Program presentation, you may be required to verify your identity with an official identity document, which reflects the name provided upon registration, for authentication and record purposes. Acceptable forms of identification include an identity document (national ID card), passport, government- or state-issued driver&#x27;s license (US and UK only), state or province ID card, or birth certificate. Landa makes use of a third-party identity verification service. If identification verification is required for your Program, non-submission of valid identification in accordance with standard verification processes will result in either restricted access to parts of the Program, or your Certificate or other Credentials being withheld upon your successful completion of a Program. If you undergo a name change during the presentation of a Program, you will be required to communicate this to your Success Adviser, who will advise you on the process to be followed. The name provided by you in the identity document that you have submitted will be the name that appears on any credentials that may be issued to you on your successful completion of a Program.<br><br><strong>Education Records</strong>: The Education Institution collaborating on your Program shall have discretion to request that we deny your registration for that Program, remove you from that Program, suspend your activity on that Program, or withhold your credentials upon successful Program completion, on the basis of written reasons related to outstanding fees owing to the Education Institution, misconduct or other lawful impediment.<br><br><strong>D. Program delivery</strong>‍<br><br>‍<strong>Relationship with Education Institution</strong>: All Programs are designed and developed in collaboration with the relevant Education Institution. However, delivery of the Program is administered by Landa.<br><br>‍<strong>Language:</strong> English is the primary language of instruction and administration for all Programs, and all coursework that is required for assessment purposes must be written in English, unless indicated otherwise. This includes posts made on the discussion forums. Programs offered in a language other than English have been translated from English. When a Program is presented in a different language (e.g., Spanish or French), all coursework that is required must be written in the language of the Program, or in the language identified to you by your learner Success team member and/or Head Tutor / Learning Facilitator (roles discussed below). Further details on the language, and any applicable assessment submission requirements, will be set out in the Program prospectus.<br><br><strong>Virtual Learning Campus</strong>/<strong>Learning Platform(s)</strong>: Our Virtual Learning Campus can be accessed using the Learning Platform’s website link provided to you with your registration. All Program-related documentation is provided in electronic format and can be accessed through the Learning Platform.<br><br><strong>Communications</strong>: You may receive communication by telephone, email, in-app messages or text messages from Landa’s representatives for Program administration and related purposes, including reminders of assignments and payments due by you, or other information related to your registration or these Terms. <strong>You agree and consent to receipt of such communications </strong>(although you may opt-out of any generic marketing communications that are unrelated to Program administration, at any time, through the supplied opt-out mechanism).<br><br><strong>Access to the Learning Platform</strong>: Upon your successful enrollment for a Program, you will be able to access the Program on the applicable Learning Platform (or, if you already have a profile, you will use your existing profile for the new Program). If you are suspended from participation in a Program (for non-payment of fees or any other valid reason), we may suspend access to your profile on the applicable Learning Platform. Please note that there may be some time delay between registration and enrollment.<br><br><strong>Permitted use: Only learners who are registered for a Program may participate in that Program. You shall not divulge your username or password to any other person, permit any other person to participate in the Program on your behalf, and/ or impersonate any other person in dealing with Landa or when accessing your Learning Platform by using another learner&#x27;s username and password. If you forget your username or password, we will only take such steps that we regard as being secure to ensure that you regain access to your profile.</strong><br><br><strong>Your responsibility in the event of unauthorized use</strong>: You agree that you will contact us immediately if you experience any unauthorized use of your profile details. You are responsible for the use of your profile on our Learning Platform, and for maintaining it and all information on it. <strong>We take security seriously, but as the user, you accept all risks of any unauthorized access that could occur regarding your information.<br><br>Access disputes</strong>: If there is a dispute as to who has the right to operate a profile on our Learning Platform, we may suspend the profile and deny access to the profile pending the outcome of the dispute to our satisfaction, and/or transfer the profile to the party claiming a right to it if we are satisfied that the profile was registered on behalf of that party.<br><br><strong>Prohibited use:</strong> You are prohibited from doing the following:<br><br>Making available copies of the Program content (or any portion thereof) on a network server, web server, or another website, for use/examination by others;<br><br>Using, displaying or otherwise making available the Program content (or any portion thereof), or any other materials, to third parties in an electronic or print format that enables it to be downloaded or distributed to any third party via a mobile device, or shared in any peer-to-peer or similar file sharing arrangement, or enabling the distribution of the Program content by any other means;<br><br>Sublicensing, reselling, renting, lending, assigning, ceding, donating or otherwise transferring or distributing the Program content or your rights granted to you under these Terms;<br><br>Reverse engineering, decompiling, or disassembling any software that is contained within Program content or on the Learning Platform; and<br><br>Removing any notice of copyright, trademark or any other proprietary right from any place where it is displayed on or embedded in the Program content (an example of this would be to edit the IPTC data).<br><br><strong>Platform capability</strong>: Our Learning Platform(s) may not be fully compatible with all mobile devices, including smartphones and tablets. In order to access and participate effectively in our Learning Platform(s), you may require access to a desktop computer or a laptop computer. You will be responsible for the cost of internet access and of any upgrades required to your computer or mobile device yourself.<br><br><strong>External websites</strong>: Certain Programs may require you to use external websites. Landa is not responsible for technical support for any external websites. If you have any queries relating to external websites, contact the support services of the relevant websites directly (although you may request assistance from a Success Adviser through the Learning Platform). Landa will not be liable for any costs, claims or damages that you may suffer as a result of your use/misuse of, or failure to access, any external website.<br><br><strong>Videos and live sessions</strong>: Videos and live sessions (when applicable) are provided in the Program modules. These videos and live sessions act as tutorials and lectures for the topics covered in the specific modules and are compulsory unless otherwise stipulated. If you are using a slower internet connection, attempts to view these videos or live sessions may be difficult.<br><br><strong>Learner Success Team</strong>: We have a support team of Success Advisers to guide you during your Programs on Landa. They will be available during the Education Institution’s business hours by telephone, email and on the discussion forum via your profile.<br><br><strong>Learning Facilitators/ Learning Advisers:</strong> The Learning Facilitators/ Learning Advisers provide guidance on Program content and academic-related queries. Interactions with them occur only on the discussion forum via your profile. They will respond to queries on the discussion forum on such days of the week and during such times as stipulated on the Program Prospectus.<br><br><strong>Education Institution:</strong> <strong>Each Program is approved by, and presented in collaboration with, a reputable Education Institution such as a university, school, college, subject matter expert, or knowledge organization. </strong>‍<br><br>‍<strong>E. Course assessments for certain Programs<br><br>General:</strong> Assessments for degree programs and short courses vary by institutions and programs. Please refer to the program prospectus.<br><br><strong>Courses/Modules:</strong> Each Program consists of Courses, while each Course consists of modules which are delivered systematically for learning effectiveness or over a specified period of time through our Learning Platform. Modules may include assignments and tasks that count towards the final Course result.<br><br><strong>Assignment submission</strong>: Assignments are due on the date and time as indicated in the Course calendar. Any queries relating to your previous assignment that may affect the submission of your next assignment should be asked on your Learning Platform discussion forum.<br><br><strong>Late submission of assignments:</strong> We recommend you stick to deadlines. However if application for an assignment extension is available, you must submit a request through the Learning Platform prior to the submission deadline of such assignment. Other requirements, processes, and limitations relating to late submission of assignments can be found in the Honor Code.<br><br><strong>Assignment rewrites</strong>: Rewrites of assignments are not permitted. Courses are based on continuous assessment and because contextual feedback is provided after each assignment, rewrites provide an unfair advantage.<br><br><strong>Assignment re-marks:</strong> Except stated otherwise for graded Courses, you may request, in writing, a re-mark of an assignment within a week of assignment scoring. However, no re-marks will be considered after the final results have been released. Please note that re-marks may result in an increase, decrease or no change to your mark. A re-mark must be requested in writing to your Lecturer or Learning Adviser before the final results have been released for the Course.<br><br><strong>Results</strong>: Your provisional result or completion status may be subject to a moderation process. If you have outstanding fees or amounts owing, your result will be withheld until such time as your fees have been settled in full. If you are dissatisfied with your academic standing (provisional result for the Course) you are within your rights to submit an appeal. You can find more information on appeal requirements and the appeals process in the Honor Code.<br><br>‍<strong>F. Learner conduct</strong>‍<br><br>‍<strong>General rules</strong>: All learners are required to adhere to an Honor Code, which must be accepted in the Orientation Module for each Course. A breach of the Honor Code will constitute a breach of this Agreement.<br><br><strong>Handbooks and Honor Codes:</strong> Handbooks, Honor Codes, rules and other materials speaking to matters such as academic integrity and conduct will be made available through the Learning Platform, and you will be obliged to abide by the terms of such additional materials in addition to these Terms.<br><br><strong>Offensive and prohibited content and communications:</strong> All communications on our forums or through our Websites, including any content published by you, must remain appropriate at all times. Landa retains the right to monitor and investigate any communication which is alleged to be offensive or specifically prohibited. Landa retains the right to take any action that we deem appropriate to ensure that each Online Learning environment remains constructive. <strong>You agree to abide by the provisions of our Website Terms of Use in relation to acceptable use policies, especially in relation to offensive and prohibited conduct. In addition, you undertake not to use Landa services to promote any business or enterprise, unless permitted to do so by a representative of Landa in writing, or unless this forms part of a Program requirement.
